A Designer's Brief
========================

#Objective and Goal

We want you to design a responsive product page (i.e. a page where you are presented with the option to purchase) for a TV Series or movie. Any TV series or movie will do and you are free to choose yourself. This is to better get a full understanding of your visual sense and ability to solve something you interact with often and that is already out there in so many shapes and forms. 

Hubrick is a platform that sets out to not only be somewhere you can find this, but also a place where users can be inspired and where they can inspire others. We are about connecting all of these things that you find online and in your daily life and making it into one experience. An experience that will be different for many people, but we will be a place where it will be your experience. 

While we don’t want to give you any definitive requirements for this, we want to provide a few helping tips towards what we are currently doing in the office. You are ofcourse free to follow or sidetrack as much as you want here. 

- Light and clean design. (We are looking to break the normal. We want to inspire users by being a visually beautiful platform)
- Emotional design (don’t be afraid to use pictures etc to create emotion)
- Two currencies (we operate with both real currency and a on-platform currency and both need to be represented somehow in the design)
- Social platform (our users are able to friend and follow each other on the platform. We try to influence all our pages with this social element. This is where the inspiration element really starts to play in)
- Cross category referencing. Hubrick is a platform with multiple categories. This gives us possibilities other platforms can’t do. For example, we could link from a Game Of Thrones video page to a product page for the wolf fur coat that Ned Stark wears (if such thing was for sale). We can inspire users with music to make them look at a travel destination. We can take that last movie you watched and give you clothing inspiration.


Don't feel like you are limited in any way creating this. If you have an idea you want to show off we are happy to see it and to discuss it with you. 

Thank you and have fun!
