A Designer's Brief
========================

#Objective and Goal

We want you to design a responsive product page (i.e. a page where you are presented with the option to purchase) for a TV Series. Any TV series will do and you are free to choose yourself. This is to better get a full understanding of your visual sense and ability to solve something you interact with often and that is already out there in so many shapes and forms. 

While we don’t want to give you any definitive requirements of what would be in the design you create, we would still want to inform about some of the basics that we use at Hubrick:

- Light design
- Emotional design (don’t be afraid to use pictures etc to create emotion)
- Two currencies (we operate with both real currency and a on-platform currency and both need to be represented in the design)
- Social platform (our users are able to friend and follow each other on the platform. We try to influence all our pages with this social element)
- User reviews 
- Cross category referencing. Hubrick is a platform with multiple categories. This gives us possibilities other platforms can’t do. For example, we could link from a Game Of Thrones video page to a product page for the wolf fur coat that Ned Stark wears (if such thing was for sale). 

Other than this the rest is up to you. Just to give you a helping hand, here is some more information of what our video pages could contain

- Basic information (we have IMDB integration so go crazy)
- Actors
- Seasons and episodes (users can buy a full season or a single episode)
- Image Gallery
