A Designers Brief
========================

#Obective and Goal
We would want you to design a responsive product page for a TV Series. Any TV series would do and you are free to choose yourself. This is to better get a full understanding of your visual sense and ability to solve something you interact with often and that is already out there in so many shapes and forms. 

While we don’t want to give you any definity requirements of what would be in the design you create we would still want to inform about some of the basics that we use on Hubrick

#Light design
Emotional design (don’t be afraid to utilize pictures etc to create emotion)
Two currencies (we operate with both real currency and a on-platform currency and both needs to be represented in the design)
Social platform (our users are able to friend and follow each other on the platform. We try to influence all our pages with this social element)
User reviews 
Cross category referencing (Hubrick is a platform with multiple category verticals. This gives us possibilities other platforms can’t do, like linking that wolf-fur coat Ned Stark is wearing in Game of Thrones, if such thing was for sale somewhere) 

Other than this the rest is up to you really. Just to give you a helping hand, here is some more information of what our video pages could contain

- Basic information (we got IMDB integration so go crazy)
- Actors
- Seasons and episodes (users can buy a full season or a single episode)
- Image Gallery
